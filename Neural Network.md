# Neural Network
(a.k.a. Multilayer Perceptron)

A Multilayer perceptron is composed of one _input layer_, one or more _hidden layers_ and one final _output layer_.

The layers at close to the input are generally called _lower layers_ while those close to the output are called _upper layers_.

A Neural Network learns by propogating errors backward (similar to the weight update in [[The Perceptron]]), by using an algorithm called [[Backpropogation Algorithm|Backpropogation]].

The 2 simplest types of Multilayer Perceptrons are:
- [[Regression Neural Networks|Regression MLPs]]
- [[Classification Neural Networks|Classification MLPs]]
